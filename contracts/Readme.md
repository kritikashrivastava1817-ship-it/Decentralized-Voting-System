# DECENTRALIZED VOTING SYSTEM

## Project Description

The Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based smart contract built on Ethereum that enables transparent, secure, and tamper-proof voting processes. This system eliminates the need for traditional centralized voting mechanisms by leveraging the immutable nature of blockchain technology to ensure vote integrity and transparency.

The smart contract allows an administrator to register voters, add candidates, manage voting periods, and conduct elections in a completely decentralized manner. All voting data is stored on the blockchain, making it publicly verifiable while maintaining the security and anonymity of the voting process.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize democratic processes by creating a trustless, transparent, and accessible voting system that:

- **Eliminates Vote Manipulation**: Uses blockchain's immutable ledger to prevent vote tampering
- **Increases Transparency**: All voting data is publicly verifiable on the blockchain
- **Reduces Costs**: Eliminates the need for physical voting infrastructure and manual counting
- **Enhances Accessibility**: Enables remote voting while maintaining security
- **Builds Trust**: Creates a system where voters can independently verify results
- **Promotes Democracy**: Makes voting more accessible to people worldwide

## Technical Specifications

### Smart Contract Features
- **Solidity Version**: ^0.8.19
- **License**: MIT
- **Gas Optimized**: Efficient storage and computation patterns
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event emission for transparency

### Core Functions
1. **registerVoter()**: Register eligible voters (owner only)
2. **castVote()**: Cast vote for a candidate (registered voters only)
3. **getResults()**: Retrieve voting results and winner information

### Security Features
- Access control modifiers
- Input validation
- State management
- Time-based controls
- Overflow protection

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- Hardhat or Truffle framework
- MetaMask wallet
- Ethereum testnet ETH

### Installation
```bash
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat deploy --network sepolia
```

### Usage
1. Deploy the contract with a voting title
2. Register voters using `registerVoter()`
3. Add candidates using `addCandidate()`
4. Start voting with `startVoting()`
5. Voters cast votes using `castVote()`
6. View results with `getResults()`
